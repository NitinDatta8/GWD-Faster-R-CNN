# PyTorch Project for global-wheat-detection
This project is based on https://github.com/L1aoXingyu/Deep-Learning-Project-Template

And I remove the high-leval api ignite which makes the project not easy to change training loop.
# Requirements
- [yacs](https://github.com/rbgirshick/yacs) (Yet Another Configuration System)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (An open source deep learning platform)
